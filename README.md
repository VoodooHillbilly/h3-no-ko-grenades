# No KO Grenades

A Hitman: World of Assassination mod that customizes grenade lock-on.

## Features

Modify thrown grenades, impact explosives, and a couple of mines to either knock down NPCs or disable lock-on entirely.

Has an option to disable dropping the impact explosive balls, Molotov, Nitroglycerin, and Octane Booster. Helpful for clumsy fingers.

Has an option to enable online use.

-   If you enable this and use the Peacock server, you need to also install [Peacock Strings](https://github.com/thepeacockproject/peacock-strings "Peacock Strings") for Peacock’s text to display properly.

## Recommendations

Also installing [Throwable Lock-On - Instinct Adjustments](https://www.nexusmods.com/hitman3/mods/738 "Throwable Lock-On - Instinct Adjustments") allows you to quickly disable lock-on by holding Instinct, for when you don’t want to hit someone in the head at all.

## Installation

You need Hitman: World of Assassination and Simple Mod Framework.
